Oplei is a personal project I am currently working on that is intended to use gamification and spaced repetition techniques to train employees at various organizations. There are a variety of possible applications, from training sales staff on product knowledge (the initial goal), to training new employees on company policy. This application is written in Ruby on Rails and involves a thorough understanding of MVC architecture, and common web technologies such as HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript(jQuery). This is a work in progress hosted on the Heroku platform and employs a PostgreSQL database.
